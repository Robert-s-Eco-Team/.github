## Robert's Eco Team

Robert's Eco Team is a project hosted by Rafael Hailu (aka HaxeFloppa) in which we try to give disposed items, like clothing, a proper use within science experiments for the sake of giving them a purpose. We're also sustainable in general.

## Teams

All of us have been seperated into two teams: The Council and Contributors.

The Council are the main members of the team. The members are HaxeFloppa/Rafael Hailu, Dankan and Samuel6124.

The Contributors are members who helped contribute to the team in general. The members of this team are Antonii2011 and akwiq.

## Collaborations
We have collaborated with other circular economy submissions to support each other and secure our chance of being a great circular economy orginization.
